### number of problems solved
⌊175×(1−0.995 **
solved
 )⌋
 
gragh approximates to 175

it have meaningful change from 0 to 400 or 600. 

after that, its almost meaningless

### contribution rates
contribution rates =⌊25×(1−0.9 **
number of contribution
 )⌋

 after 20 problems, its meaningless

 ### class bonus

to obtain a class, a problem set classified by authorization is required

 after class 5, increasing gap is reduced

 but still have value

 ### sum of difficulty of the top 100 problems
main variable

its close to linear
