1. bags or jewels one of them should be managed as two pq
-> rest one only need only one pq
- hardness of implementation : high

2. manage jewels with pq, bags with mutiset
-> component of bags should be ereased -> O(logn)
- overall time complexity is n^2
- so, using bianary search is needed
- find component in mutiset with lower_bound -> O(logn)
- then, overall time complexity is nlogn -> ac
